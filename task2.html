    <h2 id="ramayana">Ramayana</h2>
    <p>The Ramayana, attributed to the sage Valmiki, is one of the two great Indian epics. It narrates the life of
         Prince Rama, his wife Sita, and his loyal brother Lakshmana. The story follows Rama's quest to rescue Sita 
         after she is abducted by the demon king Ravana. Along the way, Rama is aided by an army of monkeys, led by 
         the devout Hanuman. The epic explores themes of duty, righteousness, loyalty, and the struggle between good 
         and evil. The Ramayana is not just a story but a cultural and spiritual guide that has influenced art, culture,
          and spirituality across India and Southeast Asia.</p>
    <h2 id="mahabharata">Mahabharata</h2>
    <p>The Mahabharata, attributed to the sage Vyasa, is the longest epic poem in the world and a foundational text of Indian 
        literature. It tells the story of the Kurukshetra War between the Pandavas and the Kauravas, two factions of a royal 
        family. The epic is a complex narrative that includes philosophical and devotional material, such as the Bhagavad Gita,
         and covers a vast array of human experiences and ethical dilemmas. It delves into themes of duty, righteousness, power,
          and the nature of reality. The Mahabharata is revered for its depth, its exploration of the human condition, 
          and its teachings on dharma (duty/righteousness).</p>
    <h2 id="bhagavadgita">Bhagavad Gita</h2>
    <p>The Bhagavad Gita, often referred to simply as the Gita, is a 700-verse scripture that is part of the Mahabharata. 
        It takes the form of a dialogue between Prince Arjuna and the god Krishna, who serves as his charioteer. On the eve
         of the great battle of Kurukshetra, Arjuna is filled with doubt and moral dilemma about fighting in the war. 
         Krishna imparts spiritual wisdom and guidance to Arjuna, addressing his doubts and encouraging him to fulfill
          his Kshatriya (warrior) duty. The Gita covers various paths to spirituality, including devotion, knowledge, 
          and disciplined action, and is considered a sacred text that provides guidance on how to live a righteous life.</p>
